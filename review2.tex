\section{Review Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose the function $f(x)=x^2+1, \ \ 0<x<3$, is expanded in a Fourier series, a cosine series, and a sine series.  Draw a sketch of each expansion from $-3<x<3$ and indicate the value to which the expansion converges at $x=0$ in each case.

\item The product of an odd function $f(x)$ with an odd function $g(x)$ is an \rule{2cm}{0.15mm} function.


\vspace{1.0cm}

\item To you were to expand $f(x)=\left|x\right|+1, \ \ -\pi < x < \pi$, in a trigonometric series, the series that would converge most quickly would be a \rule{2cm}{0.15mm} series expansion.

\item Consider Chebyshev's differential equation:
\begin{equation*}
\left(1-x^2\right)u^{\prime \prime} - xu^{\prime}+n^2u=0, \ \ -1 < x < 1
\end{equation*}
which for integer $n=0,1,2,\dots$, have polynomial solutions called Chebyshev polynomials which are denoted $T_n(x)$.  Express Chebyshev's equation in self-adjoint form and write the orthogonality relation for Chebyshev polynomials.

\item Consider a rod of length $L$ coinciding with the interval $[0,L]$ on the x-axis.  Set up the boundary-value problem for the temperature $u(x,t)$ where there is heat transfer from the left end into a surrounding medium which is maintained at a temperature of 20$^{\circ}$, and the right end is insulated.  The initial temperature throughout the rod is $f(x)$.

\item Solve the wave equation subject to the conditions:
\begin{align*}
u(0,t)&=0, \ \ u(\pi,t) = 0, \ t>0 \\
u(x,0)&=0.01 \sin{3x}, \ \ u_{t}(x,0)=0, \ \ 0<x<\pi
\end{align*}
