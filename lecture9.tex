\chapter{Lecture 9 Power Series Solutions with MATLAB}
\label{ch:lec9}
\section{Objectives}
The objectives of this lecture are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Illustrate the solution of a linear IVP (with a 3-term recurrence) using Power Series
\item Demonstrate \textbf\underline{a way} to analyze these solutions using MATLAB; and
\item Demonstrate some expected elements of MATLAB style for this course
\end{itemize}
