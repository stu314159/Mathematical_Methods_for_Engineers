\section{Systems of 1\textsuperscript{st}-Order IVPs with Euler's Explicit Method}
So far we have only addressed scalar first-order equations.  There are many physical phenomena that, in order to properly describe the relevant physics, must be modeled as a system of equations.  In this section we will consider the dynamics of the isotope xenon-135 in nuclear reactors.

\subsection{Xenon-135 Background}

Most nuclear reactors in the world today generate power through the fission of $^{235}\text{U}$.  Each fission results in the release of approximately 185 MeV of recoverable energy,\sidenote{MeV stands for ``mega-electron-volt'', or $1\times 10^6$ eV.  1eV is equivalent to $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Joules. It takes a lot of fissions to produce a discernible amount of power.} two or three neutrons, one or more of which is expected to also cause a fission thus propagating the chain reaction, and two fission products.  Almost all of the resulting fission products are radioactive, needing to undergo a series of beta- and alpha-decay processes to achieve a nuclear configuration that is stable.  This process is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:FissionProductDecayChain}.
\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{FissionProductDecayChain.eps}
\caption{Schematic of representative fission product decay process.}
\label{fig:FissionProductDecayChain}
\end{marginfigure}

Some of these fission products (and their subsequent decay offspring) have a significant impact on the nuclear chain reaction that goes on around them.  One class of fission products very influential in this way are those that have a strong tendency to absorb neutrons without undergoing fission.  These fission products are sometimes referred to as \emph{poisons}, owing to the fact that neutron absorption ``poisons'' the chain reaction process by preventing the absorbed neutron from going on to cause fission of an atom of fuel.


The particular fission product decay chain that produces $^{135}$Xe is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:decayChain}.  Tellurium-135 $\left(^{135}\text{Te}\right)$ is produced directly from fission.  It undergoes beta-decay to iodine-135 $\left(^{135}\text{I}\right)$ with a 19-second half-life.  $^{135}\text{I}$ in turn decays to xenon-135 $\left(^{135}\text{Xe}\right)$ with a slower half-life of 6.6 hours. $^{135}\text{Xe}$ is also produced in significant quantities as a fission product. $^{135}\text{Xe}$ undergoes both beta-decay to cesium-135 $\left(^{135}\text{Cs}\right)$ as well as neutron absorption---denoted with the $(n,\gamma)$ symbol for radiative capture---to become $^{136}\text{Xe}$ which is stable but a very weak neutron absorber.  $^{135}\text{Cs}$ decays to barium-135 $\left(^{135}\text{Ba}\right)$ which is a strong neutron absorber but, since the half-life is 2.3 million years, not enough $^{135}\text{Ba}$ builds up in the core to have an impact on the kinetic behavior of the fission process.

\subsection{Model of $^{135}$Xe Concentration}
We can model the atom density of $^{135}$I and $^{135}$Xe with a first-order system of differential equations.
\marginnote{Owing to the short half-life of $^{135}$Te we assume that it immediately decays and thus, effectively, is a direct production term for $^{135}$I.

\vspace{0.15cm}

\noindent Nomenclature:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I - iodine-135 atom density
\item Xe - xenon-135 atom density
\item $\phi$ - neutron flux.  Flux is proportional to reactor power; if flux is higher, reactor power is higher.
\item $\gamma$ - fission yield. The fraction of fissions that result in a particular fission product.
\item $\lambda$ - decay constant which is related to half-life: $\lambda = \sfrac{\ln{(2)}}{\text{t}_{\sfrac{1}{2}}}$
\item $\sigma_{a}$ - microscopic absorption cross-section. Represents the probability that an incident neutron will be absorbed.  Neutron ``poisons'' have large values of $\sigma_a$.
\end{enumerate}
}
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\text{I}}{dt} &= \overbrace{\gamma^{\text{Te}}\Sigma_f \phi}^{\substack{\text{production from}\\\text{fission}}} -\overbrace{\lambda^{\text{I}}\text{I}}^{\substack{\text{loss from}\\\text{decay}}}\\
\frac{d\text{Xe}}{dt} &= \underbrace{\gamma^{\text{Xe}}\Sigma_f\phi}_{\substack{\text{production}\\ \text{from}\\\text{fission}}} + \underbrace{\lambda^{\text{I}}\text{I}}_{\substack{\text{production}\\\text{from iodine}\\\text{decay}}} - \underbrace{\lambda^{\text{Xe}}\text{Xe}}_{\substack{\text{loss from}\\\text{xenon}\\\text{decay}}} - \underbrace{\text{Xe}\sigma_a \phi}_{\substack{\text{loss from}\\\text{neutron}\\\text{capture}}}
\end{align*}
This system can be solved using Euler's explicit method more-or-less in the same way that a single equation can be solved with the following equations:
\begin{align*}
y(t) &= \bracketVectorstack{\text{I(t)} \\ \text{Xe(t)}} \\
y^{\prime}(t) &= \bracketVectorstack{\text{I}(t) \\ \text{Xe}(t)}^{\prime} = \bracketVectorstack{\gamma^{\text{Te}} \Sigma_f \phi - \lambda^{\text{I}}y(1,t) \\ \gamma^{\text{Xe}}\Sigma_f \phi + \lambda^{\text{I}}y(1,t) - \lambda^{\text{Xe}}y(2,t)-y(2,t)\sigma_a \phi} 
\end{align*}
and the time-stepping formula would be:\marginnote[0.5cm]{\textbf{Note:} Here we adopt the MATLAB syntax for vectors.  We also use $dt$ to indicate the step-size.}
\begin{equation*}
y(:,t+1) = y(:,t) + y^{\prime}(:,t) \text{dt}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{MATLAB Implementation}

An analysis of $^{135}$Xe concentration through a typical power transient comprising a reactor start-up, a period of full power during which xenon levels approach equilibrium, and then a brief shutdown followed by a start-up 20 hours later is shown in the next few listings. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent We start by clearing the environment and providing necessary nuclear data. \marginnote{

\vspace{2.5cm} 

\noindent\ref{lst:ann24n-1} We us a local function (defined below) to specify the time-dependent flux profile for the transient of interest.

}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myMatlab,name=lec24n-ex1]
clear
clc
close 'all'

%% Nuclear Data
nominalFlux = 2e14; % n/cm^2-s  
flux = @(t) nominalFlux*power_profile_Xe(t); /*!\annotation{lst:ann24n-1}!*/
Sigma_F = .0452; %1/cm 
% Iodine-135  and Tellurium-135 Nuclear data
gamma_Te = 0.061; 
lambda_I = 2.9173e-5; %1/s

% Xenon-135 Nuclear data
sigma_a_Xe = 2.6e6*10^(-24); % cm^2
gamma_Xe = 0.003; 
lambda_Xe = 2.1185e-5; % 1/s 
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent Next we will set time intervals for the explicit Euler method and initialize data arrays.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myMatlab,name=lec24n-ex1]
%% Time discretization
tStart = 0; % sec - time start
tEnd = 160*3600; %sec -  time end (160 hours)
numTs = 50000; 
tSpace = linspace(tStart,tEnd,numTs);
dT = tSpace(2)-tSpace(1);

%% Construct data arrays and provide initial conditions
P = nan(2,numTs+1); % an extra column for the initial data
P(1,1) = 0; % initial I-135 concentration;
P(2,1) = 0; % initial Xe-135 concentration;
pfrac = nan(1,numTs); % power fraction

\end{lstlisting}
\noindent Now we are ready to commence time stepping.\marginnote{

\vspace{1.0cm}

\noindent\ref{lst:ann24n-2} For scripts that require more than a few seconds to run, it is a good practice to provide some intermediate output to let the user know that ``something is happening.''  At the same time, you also do not want to flood the command window with output.  Here we choose to provide a progress update every 10000 time steps.  

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent\ref{lst:ann24n-3} The notation here is somewhat clunky but these lines effectively define $y^{\prime}$.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=myMatlab,name=lec24n-ex1]
%% Commence time stepping
for ts = 1:numTs      

    if mod(ts,10000)==0  /*!\annotation{lst:ann24n-2}!*/
        fprintf('Commencing time step %i.\n',ts);
    end       
     
    dP = nan(2,1);
    T = tSpace(ts);
    pfrac(ts) = power_profile_Xe(T);
    % update Iodine concentration
    dP(1) = gamma_Te*Sigma_F*flux(T) - lambda_I*P(1,ts);  /*!\annotation{lst:ann24n-3}!*/
    % update Xenon concentration
    dP(2) = gamma_Xe*Sigma_F*flux(T) + lambda_I*P(1,ts) ...
        - P(2,ts)*sigma_a_Xe*flux(T) - lambda_Xe*P(2,ts);  
          
    % update the total poison concentration.
    P(:,ts+1) = P(:,ts) + dP*dT;    
end
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Once the calculations are done, we will plot the results.  For this transient analysis the output is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lec24n-xenon-transient-plot}.

The power profile for the transient is encoded in a local function as shown below.

% returns a power level [0,1] giving the percent full power
tH = t/3600; % convert seconds to hours.
if tH < 60
    p = 1;
elseif tH>=60 && tH<80
    p = 0;
else
    p = 1;
end
end

\section{Convert High-Order IVPs into a System of 1\textsuperscript{st}-Order IVPs}
Now that we have introduced a few methods for numerically solving initial value problems, some readers may be starting to wonder when we will include methods tailored to solve higher order IVPs.  The (possibly) surprising answer is that we will \emph{not} present new methods for solving higher-order IVPs.  Instead, \emph{all} of the numerical methods we present for IVPs will be for 1\textsuperscript{st}-order IVPs; higher-order IVPs will simply be re-stated in terms of a \emph{system} of 1\textsuperscript{st}-order IVPs.
\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{lec24n-ex2-schematic.png}
\caption{A rocket test facility idealized as a spring-mass system.}
\label{fig:lec24n-ex2-schematic}
\end{marginfigure}
Consider the following 2\textsuperscript{nd}-order IVP that captures Newton's laws of motion for a rocket test facility, idealized as a simple spring-mass system as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lec24n-ex2-schematic}.
\begin{align*}
m(t)\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+c\frac{dx}{dt} + kx &= T \\
m(t) = m_0-\dot{m}t, & \ \ x_0 = 0, \ \ v_0 = x^{\prime}(0) = 0
\end{align*}
In this expression, $c$ is a constant damping coefficient and $k$ the spring constant.  Since the rocket consumes fuel while operating, the mass of the rocket is a function of time as shown.  Lastly, initial displacement, $x_0$, and velocity, $x^{\prime}$, are given. By inspection we can see that so long as $m(t) \ne 0$ this IVP will have a unique solution. 

\noindent We will convert this 2\textsuperscript{nd}-order IVP to a system of two 1\textsuperscript{st}-order IVPs as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the governing equation in the form shown below:
\begin{equation*}
x^{\prime \prime} = -\frac{c}{m}x^{\prime} - \frac{k}{m}x + \frac{T}{m}
\end{equation*}

\item Define a new vector of dependent variables:
\begin{equation*}
w = \bracketVectorstack{x \\ x^{\prime}}
\end{equation*}

\item Write higher-order equation in terms of new vector of dependent variables:
\begin{equation*}
w^{\prime} = \bracketVectorstack{x \\ x^{\prime}}^{\prime} = \bracketVectorstack{x^{\prime} \\ x^{\prime \prime}} = \bracketVectorstack{w(2) \\ -\frac{c}{m}w(2) - \frac{k}{m}w(1) + \frac{T}{m}}
\end{equation*}

\item Solve for $w$ with your favorite method.
\end{enumerate}

A MATLAB script to solve this problem is shown in the listings below. We start by clearing out the environment and defining necessary variables.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myMatlab,name=lec24n-ex2]
clear
clc
close 'all'

%% Example #2
x0 = 0; % initial displacement
v0 = 0; % initial velocity

tMax = 5; % seconds
nT = 100000;
T = linspace(0,tMax,nT);
w = nan(2,nT);
w(:,1) = [x0;v0]; % set initial conditions
dt = T(2)-T(1);

\end{lstlisting}
We will use Euler's explicit method to solve for $w(t)$.  The results are plotted and shown in Figure \ref{fig:lec24n-ex2-plot}. 
\begin{marginfigure}[5.0cm]
\includegraphics{lec24n-ex2-plot.png}
\caption{Displacement of the rocket during a simulated powered test.}
\label{fig:lec24n-ex2-plot}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myMatlab,name=lec24n-ex2]
for t = 1:(nT-1)
    % say something comforting about program progress
    if mod(t,10000)==0
        fprintf('Commencing time step %i.\n',t);
    end
    dw = ex2(T(t),w(:,t));
    w(:,t+1) = w(:,t) + dw*dt;
end

x = w(1,:); %ft, displacement
v = w(2,:); %ft/s, velocity

%% plot the results

plot(T,x,'-c','linewidth',2);
xlabel('Time [sec]','fontsize',14,'fontweight','bold');
ylabel('Displacement [ft]','fontsize',14,...
    'fontweight','bold');
title('Rocket Displacement vs. Time',...
    'fontsize',16,'fontweight','bold');
grid on
set(gca,'fontsize',10,'fontweight','bold');
\end{lstlisting}
The equation defining $w^{\prime}(t)$ is implemented as a local function.\marginnote{

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent\ref{lst:ann24n-4} For this equation, $w^{\prime}$ is dependent on both $t$ and $w$.  Equations of this type are called \emph{non-autonomous}.  Even if the equation is \emph{autonomous}---i.e. not a function of the independent variable---you should still define your local function as $w^{\prime} = f(t,w)$.  This is because MATLAB's built-in tools for solving IVPs expect it to be defined that way.

\vspace{0.75cm}

\noindent\ref{lst:ann24n-5} The semantics of our main solver routine above expect that the output will be in the form of a column vector.
