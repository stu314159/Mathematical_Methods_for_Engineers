\begin{enumerate}
\item $x^2 u^{\prime \prime} - 2u = 0$

\vspace{1.0cm}

\item $xu^{\prime \prime} + u^{\prime} = 0$

\vspace{1.0cm}

\item $x^2 u^{\prime \prime} - 3xu^{\prime}-2u =0$

\end{enumerate}

Find the solution to the given initial value problem

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $x^2u^{\prime \prime}+3xu^{\prime} = 0, \ \ u(1) = 0, \ u^{\prime}(1)=4$

Use MATLAB to plot the solution for $x\in[1,10]$.

\item A very long cylindrical shell is formed by two concentric circular cylinders of different radii.  A chemically reactive fluid fills the space between the concentric cylinders.  The inner cylinder has a radius of 1 and is thermally insulated, while the outer cylinder has a radius of 2 and is maintained at a constant temperature $T_0$.  The rate of heat generation in the fluid due to the chemical reaction is proportional to $T/r^2$, where $T(r)$ is the temperature of the fluid within the space bounded between the cylinders defined by $1<r<2$.  Under these conditions the temperature of the fluid is defined by the following boundary value problem:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2T}{dr^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{dT}{dr}=-\frac{1}{r}T, \ \ 1 < r < 2, 
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dr}\Bigr|_{r=1} = 0, \ T(2)=T_0
\end{equation*}
Solve the boundary value problem to find the temperature of the fluid within the cylindrical shell.

For the following problems, find the radius and interval of convergence.  For the intervals of convergence, you do not need to check the endpoints (unless you want to!).
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{n}x^n$

\vspace{1.0cm}

\item $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{10^n}(x-5)^n$

\vspace{1.0cm}

\end{enumerate}
